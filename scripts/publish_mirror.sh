# scripts) never leave the private repo.

# ONE project, many markets: this ONE mirror hosts every public market
# (es de gb ercot …) under Data/<slug>/, the primary (ES) at index.html and each
# other market a first-class <slug>.html sibling, tied by a neutral Talea nav
# (render_dashboard --site). Markets stay independent units — no market is
# subordinated and none gets its own separate repo (see
# docs/talea-migration-plan.md). Replaces the separate ES-only + DE-only mirrors.
